# Aseprite Tools by @cedayhoff

Welcome to my personal collection of Aseprite tools and scripts.

This repo is where I store any utilities I’ve created for working inside Aseprite — whether for pixel art workflows, game dev support, or just easing repetitive tasks.  Starting out with one but will publish more as I clean up existing.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- Grid overlays (isometric, dimetric, square, etc.)
- UI tools built with Aseprite’s scripting API
- Helper functions and automation scripts
- Experimental or in-progress tools

---

## 💬 Usage

All scripts are provided **as-is**, without warranty or license.  
Feel free to:

- Use them in your own projects
- Modify or improve them
- Submit fixes, forks, or upgrades

If you find them helpful, great. If you break them — well, that’s part of the fun.
